Hi, I am not a coder. 
This whole thing was made using ChatGPT! 
It's just a program for processing images of books to get their listing information. 
It's really helpful to me and I'm going to keep working on it to make it better.

Please tinker with it as you see fit I hope it can help lots of fellow bookshop listers
